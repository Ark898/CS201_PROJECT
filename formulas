Alpha -> influences the probability of chosing the next node by pheromone intensity level  
Beta -> influences the probability of chosing the next node by proximity factor

desire of moving from one city to another = (T_ij)^Alpha * (N_ij)^Beta             
                                                                                 N_ij = inverse of distance between path i<->j

P_ij = {T_ij)^Alpha * (N_ij)^Beta}/ {SUM OF ALL allowed  DESIRES from city i }
